# SpeedDate

The lightweight, no-framework-necessary library for the Date object.

SpeedDate is a simple set of extension functions for the Date object.
It is designed to make working with dates in JavaScript a little less
painful!

I originally developed this in 2010, lost the files, and have just now
found them and added them to GitHub.

Patches welcome.


## TODO

2012-07-10: Add a function to calculate the position of Easter for
            any given year.
